# Physiology App Requirements

## Purpose

This web application is a simulation and educational tool aimed at students of medicine, biology, or related fields. It acts as a **replacement for PhysioEx** (by Pearson), providing a lighter, more transparent and modern alternative for conducting and understanding physiological experiments ‚Äî starting with **skeletal muscle response**. The goal is to make it both **interactive** and **visually digestible**.

---

## Tech Stack & Setup

* **Frontend**: React (set up via Vite, not CRA)
* **Language**: TypeScript
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS **v4.6**

  * Tailwind is **not used as a PostCSS plugin**
  * Imported globally in `index.css` via:

    ```css
    @import "tailwindcss";
    ```
* **Routing**: `react-router-dom`
* **Charts**: `chart.js` via `react-chartjs-2`
* **Backend**: Node.js with Express
* **Database**: SQLite (used for login state & progress persistence)
* **API**: RESTful (to be expanded as needed)
* **Documentation**: Markdown (`/docs/README.md` and others)

---

## UI Requirements

### üîê Mock Login Screen

* A simple screen with username + password fields
* No actual authentication (mock only)
* A single button to proceed

---

### üß≠ Menu Bar (Global Navigation)

* A responsive **top navigation bar** visible on all screens (except login)
* Contains:

  * **Left-aligned logo** (text or image)
  * **Right-aligned navigation links**:

    * "Experiments"
    * "Account"
* Should adapt to screen sizes (collapsible or hamburger menu on mobile)

---

### üß™ Dashboard

* Responsive dashboard showing available experiments
* Visual grid or card layout
* At least **two experiments listed**

  * One **unlocked/available**
  * One **locked/unavailable** (grayed out or with lock icon)

---

### üìä Experiment Screen

A single responsive page split into a **2x2 layout**:

#### Layout Grid:

|                          |                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **\[1] Parameters Form** | **\[2] Description & Follow-up Questions** |
| **\[3] Chart/Graph**     | **(\[2]continued)**                            |

#### \[1] Parameters Form

* Input fields that mimic a skeletal muscle testing interface
* E.g., stimulus strength, frequency, duration
* Form can be non-functional for now (mock input)

#### \[2] Description & Follow-up Panel

* Text content loaded from **external Markdown file**
* Can include explanations, experiment background, and questions
* Scrollable area, possibly with collapsible sections

#### \[3] Chart/Graph

* Line chart or bar graph generated using Chart.js
* Plots randomized values (mocked physiological response)
* Reactive to mock inputs (e.g., re-renders on submit)

---

### üí° Responsiveness & UX

* All screens must adapt gracefully to different screen sizes
* **User-adjustable panels** are desired (e.g., draggable or resizable split)
* Dark mode support

---

## Future Enhancements (not part of MVP)

* Login verification with real auth
* Saving experiment data to database
* Markdown-based experiment definitions
* Admin UI for adding/editing experiments

---

This document defines the MVP scope and frontend layout expectations. Backend functionality can be mocked for now but should be scaffolded with future expansion in mind.

# Further work

üîñ Top Navigation Menu
The application must include a top navigation menu that remains fixed at the top of the viewport. It should contain the following elements:

1. Logo (left-aligned)
Clicking the logo redirects to the homepage (or dashboard if logged in). As of now there is no homepage.

2. Navigation Links (right-aligned)
Experiments ‚Äì leads to the dashboard of available experiments.

Additional links (e.g., Dashboard, Tutorials, Docs) may be added in the future using the same style and alignment.

3. Account Menu (right-aligned)
A dropdown that includes:
- Preferences
- Log Out

4. Dark Mode Toggle (right-aligned)
A toggle switch icon (e.g., sun/moon) next to or within the account dropdown.

Toggling should immediately apply light/dark themes without a page reload using tailwind features.

The preference should be remembered between sessions (via localStorage or user settings).

The menu should be mobile friendly when viewed as such.
